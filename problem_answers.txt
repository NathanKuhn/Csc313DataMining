1. 
There are 413 unique students in this dataset.
The subjects table has the final grade for a student while the main table has any programming attempts. 
Some students may have dropped the class and therefore not received a final grade.
To obtain this answer, I created a set of student IDs and iterated over both early and late tables to populate the set. The answer was just the set size.

2.
Problem 102 had the highest average attempts per student (10.42)
To obtain this answer I counted number of attempts per problem and kept track of a set of students who had attempted the problem.
Each problem average could be found with the attempts over the size of each student set.
The answer was the maximum average value.

3.
Problem 13 had the highest average number of compiler errors per student (7.95)
Knowing which problem had more errors per student would be more meaningful, as this better shows difficulty.
To obtain this, I iterated over the main table and kept track of errors per problem and students per problem using a set.
I then did the same operation to obtain an average for each as in problem 2.
The answer was the maximum average value.
